<p><a href="http://epa.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/me.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin-right:2em;" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-149" title="Edward Andrews" alt="Edward Andrews" src="http://epa.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/me-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300" /></a>I'm Edward Andrews.  I live in York, where I moved for university nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p>I work for <a href="http://yoomee.com">yoomee</a> as a ruby on rails developer.  Yoomee creates digital platforms for social change.  We develop websites for charities and third sector organisations in the UK and abroad.  It's a great job and a great company to work for!</p>
<p>In my personal life, I sing in a local choir, cycle a lot (commuting and pleasure), do yoga and spend time doing fun things with my children.  I enjoy taking photographs and you can see loads of them on <a href="http://flickr.com/aldreth">flickr</a>.</p>
