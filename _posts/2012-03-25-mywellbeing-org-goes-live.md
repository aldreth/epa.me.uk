<p>The site that I have been working on since the end of October has now gone live - <a href="http://ogilvyeast.mywellbeing.org">ogilvyeast.mywellbeing.org</a>.</p>

<p>I'm really excited that it's actually up and running.  The new design looks really good, the front end is pretty much finished and the back end works.  There are still bits of tidying up to do and then there are lots of extensions we still want to add to make the content even more flexible as we add new clients.</p>
<p>The site is really flexible - it serves different content depending on the subdomain, articles can be shown or hidden for particular subdomains, the frontpage can be customised, the logo and background logo can be different.  We also have different user types, with different editing rights, so that our core content can't be changed, but clients can add their own custom information.</p>
<p>We will be gradually moving current clients from the old system to the new one over the next couple of months.</p>
