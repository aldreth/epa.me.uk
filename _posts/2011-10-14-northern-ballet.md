<p>I had a 6 month work placement at <a title="Northern Ballet" href="http://www.northernballet.com/">Northern Ballet</a>.  They had just moved to their beautiful new building in Quarry Hill.</p>
<p>While I was there I helped with the transfer to their new website, which is built using Drupal.  I built picture heavy pages - I was responsible for selecting and editing all the pictures I used.  Some of the pages (particularly for past productions) used jquery based pop up galleries or jquery accordion style expanding pages.</p>
