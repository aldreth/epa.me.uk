<p>As part of my Digital Media and Communications module for my masters degree, I built a website for a primary school.  I used drupal as I know it well and it expands easily.</p>
<p>I considered the different audiences that might use the site (parents, prospective parents and children) and made sure the front page had clear navigation to the information they might need.</p>
<p>There is a blog that could be updated regularly by the headteacher or support staff.</p>
<p>All content can be tagged by age group and subject to produce automatically built, expanding areas of the site for each subject and class.</p>
<p>There is also an art gallery and a calendar for the school.  The different parts of the site were put together using drupal modules - <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">views</a>; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/date">date</a> &amp; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/calendar">calendar</a>; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/simplenews">simplenews</a>; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/lightbox">lightbox</a>; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/webform">webform</a> and several more.  Drupal is very adaptable and has loads of modules to extend its functionality.</p>
<p>I chose a theme that was suitable for a primary school - bright, colourful and clear.  It has a rotating image in the top bar to show off pictures children had created.</p>
<p>I got a distinction for this module.</p>
