<p>My Database Design and Implementation module involved thinking about the organisation of the London Olympics.  First we modelled the data that would be needed.</p>

[![Composite QSEE Olympic games model](/assets/olympics/Composite-QSEE-Olympic-games-model-300x180.jpg)](/assets/olympics/Composite-QSEE-Olympic-games-model.jpg)

<p>Then we implemented parts of the system in Oracle Apex to produce a web accessible database.</p>
<p>The most complicated thing I made was a trigger that would check to see if an official already had something in their schedule 2 hours either side a new record in the schedule.</p>

```sql
CREATE
OR
replace TRIGGER "SCHEDULE_OFFICIAL_TIME_T1" BEFORE
INSERT
ON "SCHEDULE" FOR EACH ROW WHEN (
              NEW.date_time IS NOT NULL) BEGIN DECLARE l_exists INTEGER;

BEGIN
  SELECT count(*)
  INTO   l_exists
  FROM   schedule
  WHERE  official_id = :new.official_id
  AND    date_time BETWEEN :new.date_time - interval '120' minute AND :new.date_time + interval '120' minute
  AND    ROWNUM = 1;

  IF l_exists = 1 THEN
    Raise_application_error(-20634, 'This time is within 2 hours of another scheduled time for this official.');
  END IF;
END;
END;
â€‹
```

<p>The finished web app allowed you to view a few reports I had created, including one official's schedule.  It also allowed you to create and edit venues, events, officials, schedules etc.  I got apex to allow a drop down date and time picker, drop down lists of available venues and so on.</p>
<p>I got a distinction for this module.</p>
