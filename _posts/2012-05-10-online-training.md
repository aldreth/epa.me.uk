<p>I've been working on my second rails app, which is now up on a staging site - <a href="http://trainingstage.ntistudio.co.uk/">trainingstage.ntistudio.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>I've been working on this with my colleague, Edward Robinson. It's been an opportunity for him to learn more about rails, and I've been using it to learn more about routes and about testing.</p>
<p>The application uses a lot of nested routes - deep and shallow nesting. It was interesting playing with these and learning more about how easy it is to configure rails routing.</p>
<p>We've also been using the twitter bootstrap gem to scaffold styles, to take advantage of the responsive design, typography and jquery features bootstrap provides.</p>
