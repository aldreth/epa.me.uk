<p>I am responsible for keeping the Friargate Quakers list of Members and Attenders up to date.  When this was passed onto me, it was an excel spreadsheet.  However the information is required in lots of different formats, and with different bits of information depending on the data protection preferences of each person.</p>
<p>So... I decided to build a database as part of the Meeting website, which I also run.  It displays people in families, only displaying couples with the same surname once.  Children are displayed in italics with their parents.</p>
<p>I have blurred details in the photos for privacy reasons, but you can see that "Angus" has information in red in the full list, which is not displayed in the national list.  This is because of a choice she made on the data protection form.</p>
<p>It is also possible to get lists of birthdays and ages for the children, and for adults with significant birthdays, and to get lists of how many people are on the list for the annual return to Yearly Meeting.  It is also possible to display people on a google map, using the postcode from their address.</p>
