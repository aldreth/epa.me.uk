<p>For the <a title="Northern Ballet - Our People" href="http://www.northernballet.com/index.php?q=our-people">Our People</a> page on the Northern Ballet site I found and customised a jquery gallery carousel.  There are a lot out there, and after some testing of different alternatives the one I chose was <a href="http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/">jCarousel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/">jCarousel</a> has lots of customisations, such as vertical carousels or lightbox pop ups.  It seems lightweight and adaptable.</p>
<p><a style="font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://epa.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/nb.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-67" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 0.4em; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #eeeeee;" title="Northern Ballet - Our People" src="http://epa.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/nb-300x251.png" alt="Northern Ballet - Our People" width="300" height="251" /></a></p>
