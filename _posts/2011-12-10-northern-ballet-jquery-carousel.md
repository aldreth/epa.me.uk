<p>For the <a title="Northern Ballet - Our People" href="http://www.northernballet.com/index.php?q=our-people">Our People</a> page on the Northern Ballet site I found and customised a jquery gallery carousel.  There are a lot out there, and after some testing of different alternatives the one I chose was <a href="http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/">jCarousel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/">jCarousel</a> has lots of customisations, such as vertical carousels or lightbox pop ups.  It seems lightweight and adaptable.</p>
